# Project Outline

## 1. Task - Collect and analyze weather data across different cities

## 2. Purpose - PlanMyTrip App will use this data to guide locals about hotel recommendations based on their chosen weather preferences

## 3. Method - Creating a pandas dataframe with 500 or more cities across the world along with their weather data in real time.

Our analysis focused on data collectuon based on City, Country, Date, Latitude and Longitude and weather conditions (which were further broken down into humidity, cloudiness, wind speed and temperature)

We then created visuals using scatter plots, determined the correlations with various elements and created heat maps using Google Maps and Places APIs.

Finally we structured information for Travel Data for certain cities based on preferences. We used Pandas DataFrame based on user inputs for a minimum and maximum temperature, created heat maps for new dataframe, found cities and coordinates using APIs (Google and Places) and created pop up markers for the short-listed cities in our final.
